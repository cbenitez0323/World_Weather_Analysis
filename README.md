# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The analysis is broken up into three parts. The first takes log and lat coordinates and finds the nearest corresponding city. Then using an API call to OpenWeatherMap to find weather data of each respective city. The second part narrows down that data by nice vacation weather and finds the nearest hotel. A google maps is then created that shows the hotel locations. Finally, an itinerary is created where 4 hotels in a country are then mapped out showing the directions for each spot.
